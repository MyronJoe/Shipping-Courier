                    <h2 class="my-3">Was Our Solution Best?</h2>

                    <p>ShipTop utilizes express shipping by air, allowing us to complete any air cargo delivery globally or within the United States and Canada in a matter of hours. Instead of maintaining our own aviation fleet, we coordinate the services of multiple cargo airlines to get your freight wherever you need it to be. This is the logistical strength and knowhow ShipTop provides across all of its services. We dive deep into air cargo schedules and have an in-depth understanding of global cargo routes. We investigate each airline carefully, ensuring they have the skills and resources to keep our clients’ items safe from start to finish. These critical business partnerships benefit our customers through competitive rates, superior service, and most importantly – getting to the destination on time with your air cargo safe and secure. No matter how tight a client’s deadline or how delicate the items they’re shipping, we have the resources and expertise to deliver them anytime, anywhere.</p>
